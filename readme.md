# iwutil
Just a small cli tool to quickly connect to a wifi with iwctl

## Usage
To use it you just run the tool, and then it scans the available networks, then you choose the one you want to connect to. It supports both networks with and without a password.

You can also quickly disconnect from a network with
```bash
